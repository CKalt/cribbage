# Research Request: Improved AI Expert Mode for Cribbage

Claude,

I would like a structured research document exploring how to evolve the
current single-player AI in my Cribbage application into an "Expert
Mode" without discouraging existing high-engagement users.

Please generate your response as:

prompts/improved-ai-expert-mode-research.md

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Context

-   The current single-player AI is stable and engaging.
-   A highly engaged user has logged 400+ wins with \~78% win rate.
-   I do NOT want to secretly increase difficulty.
-   I want to design a transparent "Expert Mode" or advanced difficulty
    tier.
-   The broader long-term vision includes this game becoming part of the
    SKnowball ecosystem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Goals

Please explore the following areas:

### 1. Cribbage AI Strategy Improvements

-   Pegging optimization strategies
-   Discard heuristics (expected value analysis)
-   Endgame board-position strategy
-   Card-counting approximation techniques
-   Risk-adjusted play models

### 2. Difficulty Scaling Models

-   Fixed difficulty tiers (Normal, Expert, etc.)
-   Adaptive AI (ELO-like adjustment)
-   Player opt-in escalation models
-   Psychological considerations of difficulty increases

### 3. Protecting Existing High-Skill Users

-   Best practices for introducing new difficulty modes
-   Avoiding discouragement or trust erosion
-   Recognition systems for early dominant users
-   Beta-tester / "Founding Player" approaches

### 4. Architectural Considerations

-   How to modularize AI logic for tiered difficulty
-   Feature flags for experimentation
-   Logging data needed to evaluate AI strength

### 5. SKnowball Integration Potential

-   How Expert Mode could later tie into:
    -   Identity
    -   Skill tiers
    -   Cross-node reputation
    -   Lightweight social signaling

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Output Requirements

-   Structured sections with clear headings.
-   Concrete implementation suggestions.
-   No generic filler.
-   Practical, developer-level insight.
-   Optional: diagrams or flow descriptions in markdown if useful.

This is research only --- no code generation yet.

Focus on clarity, depth, and actionable insight.

Chris
