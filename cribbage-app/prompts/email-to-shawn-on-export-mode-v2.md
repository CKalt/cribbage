# Expert Mode Just Got Tougher!

Hi Shawn! Quick heads-up about an important change to Expert Mode.

We discovered that the Expert AI had a flaw that was actually making it WEAKER, not stronger. It was deliberately overcounting its hand about 15% of the time as a "bluff" — but if you were catching those with muggins calls, you were getting free points every time! That means the computer was essentially handing you points.

We've fixed this. The Expert AI now always counts its hand accurately — no more free muggins points. This means Expert Mode is now genuinely harder, and you may notice your win percentage drops a bit as a result.

Don't worry — your past wins absolutely count! But from here on, every point the Expert claims will be the real deal. We think you're up for the challenge.

More Expert improvements are on the way. Game on!
