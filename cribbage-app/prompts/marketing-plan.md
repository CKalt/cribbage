## Overview

Cribbage at [cribbage.chrisk.com](https://cribbage.chrisk.com) is a polished single-player cribbage game with Expert Mode AI, muggins rules, and a leaderboard. The current user base is small but engaged — notably Shawn, who has played 500+ games.

This plan outlines a strategy to grow membership by leveraging the existing product strengths, building community features around the upcoming multiplayer mode, and positioning the app within the broader **SKnowball** ecosystem.

The core thesis: **cribbage players are community-oriented by nature** — they play at kitchen tables, in pubs, and in clubs. An online cribbage community that captures that social feel will grow through word of mouth if we give players reasons to invite their friends.

## Problem Statement

1. **Discovery**: Players don't know we exist. There is no organic acquisition channel.
2. **Retention hook**: Single-player is engaging but finite — once you've beaten the AI, what's next?
3. **Social loop**: There is no mechanism for players to bring their friends into the app.
4. **Community identity**: The app is a standalone game, not yet part of a larger story that gives players a sense of belonging.

The multiplayer mode (currently in beta) and the **SKnowball** umbrella will address all four.

## Phase 1: Foundation — Polish the Single-Player Experience

*Goal: Make the current product impressive enough that players want to share it.*

### 1.1 Expert Mode Launch Announcement

- [ ] Craft a short email / in-app announcement to existing users about Expert Mode
- [ ] Highlight the challenge: "Can you beat the AI when it plays optimally?"
- [ ] Include a call-to-action: "Share with a friend who thinks they're good at cribbage"

**Why it matters**: Expert Mode is a differentiator. Most online cribbage games have weak AI. Ours evaluates every possible cut card. That's a selling point for serious players.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 1.2 Leaderboard Visibility and Social Proof

- [ ] Add a public leaderboard page (no login required to view)
- [ ] Show top players by win count and win rate (Normal and Expert)
- [ ] Add "Join to compete" call-to-action for visitors

**Why it matters**: Public leaderboards create aspirational goals and let players show off their rank.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 1.3 Invite-a-Friend Flow

- [ ] Add a "Challenge a Friend" button on the menu that generates a shareable link
- [ ] Link leads to a signup page with a message like "Your friend [name] challenged you to cribbage"
- [ ] Track referral source for attribution

**Why it matters**: The single most effective growth channel for games is personal invitation. Make it frictionless.

## Phase 2: Community — Multiplayer and Social Features

*Goal: Transform the app from a solo experience into a community. This is the growth engine.*

### 2.1 Multiplayer Beta Waitlist

- [ ] Add a "Multiplayer Coming Soon" banner on the main menu
- [ ] Collect email sign-ups for beta access
- [ ] When multiplayer launches, send invites in waves to create exclusivity and buzz

**Why it matters**: Anticipation drives engagement. Players who sign up for a waitlist have already committed psychologically.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 2.2 Community Leaderboard and Seasons

- [ ] Introduce seasonal leaderboard resets (e.g., monthly or quarterly)
- [ ] Archive previous seasons so players can see their history
- [ ] Separate leaderboards: vs AI (Normal), vs AI (Expert), vs Humans (multiplayer)

**Why it matters**: Seasons create recurring engagement loops. "New season starts Monday" is a reason to come back.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 2.3 Player Profiles and Match History

- [ ] Give each player a profile page showing stats, recent games, and achievements
- [ ] Allow players to set a display name and optional avatar
- [ ] Show head-to-head records in multiplayer

**Why it matters**: Identity drives investment. When players have a profile they've built up, they're less likely to leave.

## Phase 3: Growth — The SKnowball Philosophy

*Goal: Position cribbage within a larger ecosystem that compounds growth across properties.*

### 3.1 What is SKnowball?

**SKnowball** is the overarching umbrella philosophy that connects this cribbage app to a broader family of community-driven experiences. The core idea:

> Each product in the SKnowball ecosystem makes every other product stronger — like a snowball rolling downhill, gathering mass. Players who join for cribbage discover other offerings; users from other properties discover cribbage. Growth compounds.

*(Further details on SKnowball's full scope and vision to be provided by Chris.)*

- [ ] Define SKnowball branding guidelines and shared identity
- [ ] Create a "Part of the SKnowball family" footer badge
- [ ] Establish cross-property user accounts (single sign-on potential)

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 3.2 Cross-Pollination with Other SKnowball Properties

- [ ] Add "Discover more from SKnowball" section in the app
- [ ] Share user base across properties (with consent) for cross-promotion
- [ ] Joint launch events when new properties are added to the SKnowball family

**Why it matters**: Each new property in the ecosystem brings its own audience. Cribbage players become aware of other offerings, and vice versa. This is the compounding growth effect.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 3.3 Content and Organic Discovery

- [ ] Create a "Learn Cribbage" tutorial page (SEO target: "how to play cribbage online")
- [ ] Blog posts: strategy guides, hand analysis, "How Expert Mode AI works"
- [ ] Social media presence for the SKnowball brand that features cribbage content

**Why it matters**: Organic search is the highest-quality free acquisition channel. People searching "play cribbage online" are exactly our target audience.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

## Phase 4: Retention — Keep Players Coming Back

*Goal: Turn one-time visitors into daily players.*

### 4.1 Daily and Weekly Challenges

- [ ] "Hand of the Day" — a fixed hand where all players compete for the best score
- [ ] Weekly challenge: "Win 5 games on Expert this week"
- [ ] Show progress toward challenges on the main menu

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 4.2 Achievement System

- [ ] Milestones: 10 wins, 50 wins, 100 wins, first Expert win, first 0-point hand caught via muggins
- [ ] Display badges on player profile
- [ ] "Rare" achievements that create talking points ("I got a 29 hand!")

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 4.3 Email Engagement (Opt-In)

- [ ] Weekly digest: "Your stats this week" + leaderboard position
- [ ] Notify players when a friend joins or when their record is beaten
- [ ] New feature announcements

## Phase 5: Getting the Word Out — Outreach and Distribution

*Goal: Actively put the app in front of cribbage players where they already gather.*

Phases 1-4 make the product worth sharing. This phase ensures people actually hear about it. A great product with no distribution is invisible.

### How This Phase Works

**Claude prepares, you oversee, a human posts.**

| Step | Who | What |
|------|-----|------|
| 1. Draft | Claude | Writes the post/copy/article tailored to each platform |
| 2. Review | Chris | Reads the draft, edits tone/claims, approves or requests changes |
| 3. Decide voice | Chris | Choose who posts: Chris, his daughter (with her approval), or a SKnowball brand account |
| 4. Publish | Chris or daughter | Logs into the platform and posts the approved content |
| 5. Monitor | Claude + Chris | Claude can help draft follow-up replies; Chris/daughter handles the conversation |

**Important**: Claude cannot create accounts, log into platforms, or post directly. All published content goes through a human who approves and owns it.

**Voice options**:
- **Chris**: "I built this cribbage game..." — authentic indie developer story, works well on Reddit, HN, dev communities
- **Daughter**: "My dad built this cribbage app..." — wholesome family angle, works well on social media, general audiences
- **SKnowball brand**: Neutral voice for directory listings, formal outreach, and SEO content

---

### 5.1 Cribbage Communities and Forums

Each post below will be drafted by Claude as a ready-to-paste document for Chris to review.

| Platform | Audience | Angle | Deliverable |
|----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| **r/cribbage** (~15k) | Serious players | "Expert AI evaluates every cut card" | 🤖 Draft Reddit post |
| **r/WebGames** | Casual gamers | "Free browser cribbage, no install" | 🤖 Draft Reddit post |
| **BoardGameGeek** | Board game enthusiasts | Strategy depth + AI strength | 🤖 Draft forum post |
| **Cribbage Corner** | Dedicated cribbage community | Practice tool + muggins rules | 🤖 Draft forum post |
| **Facebook groups** | Casual to serious players | Community + multiplayer coming soon | 🤖 Draft FB post |

- [ ] 🤖 Claude drafts all 5 posts (one per platform, tailored to each audience)
- [ ] 👤 Chris reviews and picks the voice (self, daughter, or brand)
- [ ] 👤 Chris/daughter creates accounts if needed and posts approved content
- [ ] 🤖 Claude drafts follow-up replies as conversations develop

**Approach**: Don't spam. Each post should be genuine and provide value (strategy insight, interesting AI detail) — not just "check out my app." These are tight-knit communities that smell marketing a mile away.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 5.2 Social Media and Video

**What Claude can prepare:**
- [ ] 🤖 Draft Twitter/X thread: "How we built a cribbage AI that evaluates 690 hands per decision"
- [ ] 🤖 Draft tweet-sized posts for ongoing sharing (interesting hands, AI bluff stories, milestones)
- [ ] 🤖 Write video scripts for short-form content:
  - "Watch Expert AI find the optimal discard in real time"
  - "Can you spot the overcount? Muggins challenge"
  - "29-hand — the rarest hand in cribbage"
- [ ] 🤖 Write a YouTube script: "I built an AI that plays cribbage better than you"

**What requires a human:**
- [ ] 👤 Record screen captures / video of gameplay
- [ ] 👤 Voiceover or on-camera (daughter could be great for this — relatable, fresh angle)
- [ ] 👤 Post to TikTok / YouTube / Instagram from personal or SKnowball account
- [ ] 👤 Engage with comments and build audience

**Why video works**: Cribbage is visual — cards, scoring, pegging. A 30-second clip of the AI making a brilliant discard decision is inherently interesting to cribbage players.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 5.3 App Store and Directory Listings

These are mostly one-time submissions. Claude drafts the copy, Chris submits.

- [ ] 🤖 Draft **Product Hunt** launch page copy (tagline, description, first comment)
- [ ] 👤 Chris submits to Product Hunt (schedule for a Tuesday, best launch day)
- [ ] 🤖 Draft **AlternativeTo** listing (as alternative to Cribbage Pro, Cribbage JD, etc.)
- [ ] 👤 Chris submits to AlternativeTo
- [ ] 🤖 Draft listings for web game directories (itch.io, CrazyGames)
- [ ] 👤 Chris submits to directories
- [ ] 🤖 Build a Progressive Web App (PWA) manifest so players can "install" on mobile
- [ ] 🤖 Optimize landing page / meta tags for SEO targets:
  - "play cribbage online free"
  - "cribbage game vs AI"
  - "cribbage with muggins rules"

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 5.4 Partnerships — Clubs, Tournaments, and Leagues

These require a personal touch. Claude drafts outreach emails, Chris sends them.

- [ ] 🤖 Draft email to **American Cribbage Congress (ACC)** — offer as free online practice tool for members
- [ ] 🤖 Draft email template for local cribbage clubs and leagues
- [ ] 🤖 Draft partnership pitch for cribbage board makers / Etsy sellers
- [ ] 👤 Chris sends emails from personal or SKnowball address
- [ ] 👤 Chris follows up on responses and manages relationships
- [ ] 🤖 Draft tournament rules/format if Chris decides to host an online tournament

**Why partnerships matter**: ACC has 10,000+ members. A single mention in their newsletter reaches exactly the right audience with zero ad spend.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 5.5 Press, Hacker News, and Dev Community

The technical story (EV discard AI, 690 evaluations per decision) is genuinely interesting to developer audiences.

- [ ] 🤖 Draft **"Show HN"** post for Hacker News — focus on the AI engineering angle
- [ ] 👤 Chris posts to HN (needs an account with some karma ideally)
- [ ] 🤖 Write a full blog post: "Building a cribbage AI that evaluates every possible cut card"
- [ ] 🤖 Draft pitches to indie game blogs and web dev publications
- [ ] 👤 Chris sends pitches from personal email
- [ ] 🤖 Build a "Share your stats" feature — generates a shareable image card with win record
- [ ] 🤖 Build a "Challenge a friend" link — when multiplayer launches, every game is an implicit invitation

**The compounding effect**: Each channel feeds the others. A Reddit post drives sign-ups, new players create leaderboard activity, leaderboard screenshots get shared on social media, social media drives more sign-ups. This is the **SKnowball** principle in action.
